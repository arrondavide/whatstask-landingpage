- **Complete Task Management System** with subtasks, recurring tasks, attachments
- **Time Tracking System** with clock in/out, duration tracking
- **Team & Company Management** with roles (Admin/Manager/Employee)
- **Multi-Tenancy** - switch between multiple companies
- **Statistics & Reporting** - personal and team analytics
- **Collaboration** - comments, assignments, notifications
